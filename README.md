# Simple Chatty Bot
- I tried to create a simple chat bot with all basic python code. I used for and while loop along with string and input methods to create this program.
- It asks your name, guesses your age correctly using a math formula, counts till a number specified and has a multiple choice question (MCQ) at the end.
- Its main feature is that in MCQ, it prompts user to enter correct value until the correct answer is specified.
